<div class="content-holder holder_13"><a name="holder_13" id="holder_13"></a><div><p><b>12. Your California Privacy Rights</b></p>
<p>Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, subject to certain restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests.</p>
<p><b>Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>California residents have the right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, and share. You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.</p>
<p><b>Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>You may also request that we delete personal information that we collected from you. Some information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Properties to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Properties.</p>
<p><b>How to Exercise Your Access and Deletion Rights</b></p>
<p>For security purposes, we will verify your identity – including requesting information from you – when you request to exercise your California privacy rights. If you have an online account you use to interact with Activision, logging into your account will serve to verify your identity and request. We may request additional information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, then we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought.</p>
<p>Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate. If we are unable to complete your requests, we will provide you information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.</p>
<p><b>Right to Nondiscrimination</b></p>
<p>We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.</p>
<p><b>Sale of Personal Information</b></p>
<p>California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information, as defined by the CCPA. We have not sold personal information about you in the last 12 months, unless you have played Activision’s mobile games. California law broadly defines “sale” in a way that may include when we allow third parties to receive certain information about mobile game use, such as Cookies, IP address, and/or browsing behavior, to deliver targeted advertising on the Properties or other services. Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us to provide you offers relevant to you. For mobile targeted advertising purposes this information includes: demographic and statistical information, user-generated content, device information and identifiers, connection and usage data, geolocation, and social media information. To opt out of the use of your data for advertising purposes please see the Mobile Advertising section above. You may also opt out through the settings page of Activision mobile applications that may share your data for these purposes. Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.</p>
<p><b>Authorized Agents</b></p>
<p>You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA as described above. We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.</p>
<p><b>California Shine the Light Law</b></p>
<p>Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share our customer's personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. For inquiries regarding our disclosure policy, please send us an email, or write us at: Activision Publishing, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405 USA, ATTN: Privacy Team/Privacy Policy. We will be happy to honor your request.</p>
<p><b>California Privacy Rights for Minor Users</b></p>
<p>We will be happy to review, update or remove Information and/or content as appropriate. Residual copies of Information and/or content that have been removed from your account and/or the Properties may remain in our backup systems for approximately one month. We may still retain your Information to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, or comply with legal requirements; in this case, your personal information will be blocked from use for any other purpose.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Track</b></p>
<p>California Business and Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) permits our customers who are California residents to be informed as to how Activision responds to Web browser "Do Not Track" settings. As Do Not Track is a standard that is currently being developed, Activision does not take actions to respond to Do Not Track settings, and instead we adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<div class="content-holder holder_17"><a name="holder_17" id="holder_17"></a><div><p><b>13. Privacy Information for Nevada Residents</b><br>
Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such terms are defined under Nevada law) for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Covered information” includes first and last name, address, email address, and phone number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. As discussed above, we share your information with certain third parties that we believe can provide you with offers and promotions for products and service of interest to you and in the other ways described above. We do not believe that our sharing in this regard would qualify as a sale under Nevada law. Nonetheless, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to record your preference to opt out by emailing us. Please note we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.</p>

<div class="content-holder holder_14"><a name="holder_14" id="holder_14"></a><div><p><b>14. Users in the EEA</b></p>
<p>As set out in more detail below, we only process or transfer your personal information where we can rely on legal grounds and appropriate safeguards to do so. You also have additional rights regarding your personal information if you are located in the European Economic Area (“<b>EEA</b>”).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="content-holder holder_15"><a name="holder_15" id="holder_15"></a><div><p><b>15. Disclosure to Users Outside the US and the EEA</b></p>
<p>In addition, if you are a visitor to our websites or other online products and services from outside the U.S., the personal information you provide will be collected, processed and stored directly on, or transferred to, servers in the United States or other countries where Activision group companies or our other partners or vendors maintain facilities or business operations.</p>
<p>No matter where the Information is located, Activision takes commercially reasonable measures to safeguard your privacy rights in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the collection, processing, storage and transfer of your Information, please do not provide your Information when requested and stop using our websites and other online products and services.</p>
